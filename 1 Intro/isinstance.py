"""
classinfo is not a type or tuple of types, a TypeError exception is raised.

Example 1: How isinstance() works?
"""
class Foo:
  a = 5
  
fooInstance = Foo()

print(isinstance(fooInstance, Foo))
print(isinstance(fooInstance, (list, tuple)))
print(isinstance(fooInstance, (list, tuple, Foo)))

numbers = [1, 2, 3]

result = isinstance(numbers, list)
print(numbers,'instance of list?', result)

result = isinstance(numbers, dict)
print(numbers,'instance of dict?', result)

result = isinstance(numbers, (dict, list))
print(numbers,'instance of dict or list?', result)

number = 5

result = isinstance(number, list)
print(number,'instance of list?', result)

result = isinstance(number, int)
print(number,'instance of int?', result)
